<p>I wanted to use my phone to make a list of the mats I needed instead of switching windows.
Couldn&#8217;t find anything that I liked in 10 minutes so I took 3 4 hours to write something that fitted <em>my very own special personal needs</em>.</p>

<h2 id="instalation">Instalation</h2>

<p>Wanna run this locally? Awesome!</p>

<ol>
<li>Have Node and NPM</li>
<li>Clone the repo</li>
<li><code>npm install</code></li>
</ol>

<p><em>Note:</em> <em>Currently, this uses PostCSS for CSS becauseâ€¦I really have no good reason other than I was lazy to think a better way for autoprefixer.</em></p>

<h2 id="qa">Q&amp;A</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Q: Ewwwww it uses jQuery instead of React~
A: Yes! It&#8217;s easier for people contributing. Also, Github pages hosting :v</p></li>
<li><p>Q: But, can I like, switch it to React?
A: If you&#8217;re gonna be handling the server-side and maintenance, please be my guest.</p></li>
<li><p>Q: What if I want to rewrite your lazy jQuery?
A: Go ahead! Submit your PR.</p></li>
<li><p>Q: I found a bug but don&#8217;t want to fix it myself
A: Please, submit an issue. Maybe I&#8217;ll find time to adress it in the future.</p></li>
<li><p>Q: I have an idea for future functionality!
A: Great! Also open an issue with it so someone can pick it up and work on it.</p></li>

-[] Saving sessions on device
-[] Totals of individual mats, instead of separating them per item</p>
