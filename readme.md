## FFXIV Crafting Shopping List
I wanted to use my phone to make a list of the mats I needed instead of switching windows.
Couldn't find anything that I liked in 10 minutes so I took 3 4 hours to write something that fitted _my very own special personal needs_.

## Instalation
Wanna run this locally? Awesome!
1. Have Node and NPM
2. Clone the repo
3. `npm install`

*Note:* _Currently, this uses PostCSS for CSS becauseâ€¦I really have no good reason other than I was lazy to think a better way for autoprefixer._


## Q&A
* Q: Ewwwww it uses jQuery instead of React~
  A: Yes! It's easier for people contributing. Also, Github pages hosting :v

* Q: But, can I like, switch it to React? 
  A: If you're gonna be handling the server-side and maintenance, please be my guest.

* Q: What if I want to rewrite your lazy jQuery?
  A: Go ahead! Submit your PR. 

* Q: I found a bug but don't want to fix it myself
  A: Please, submit an issue. Maybe I'll find time to adress it in the future.

* Q: I have an idea for future functionality!
  A: Great! Also open an issue with it so someone can pick it up and work on it.

## Contributing
All contributions to this are super welcome!
1. Fork
2. Create your branch
3. Do your code
4. Submit PR

## Future Functionality I'd like to add
- [] Showing/hiding shards needed
- [] Craftable amount counter, so if you want to craft more than just one you'll know how the exact mats amount you need
- [] Asigning items/mats to someone using their lodestone ID
- [] Saving sessions on device
- [] Totals of individual mats, instead of separating them per item
